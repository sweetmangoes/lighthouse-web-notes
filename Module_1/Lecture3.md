# Callbacks

## Functions as Values
* Just like everything is else in javascript, functions are values. 
* As a result, they can be stored in variables just like any other value. 
``` js
//addTwo is a variable that holds a _reference_ to a function.
const addTwo = function(num) {
  return num + 2;
}
```
* They can also be passed around just like any other variables. 
``` js
 const addDeux = addTwo; //alias `addTwo` as `addDeux`.
console.log(addTwo);
console.log(addDeux);
addDeux(3); // equivalent to calling myFunction()
```

## Function calling vs function passing
* Note that the () is only used when invoking (or calling) a function.
``` js
const addDeux = addTwo; // assigning a function to variable "addDeux"
...
const result = addDeux(3); // invoke the function, and assign its return value to variable "result"
```
* And they can be passed to other functions as arguments.
```js
const addTwo = function(num) {
    return num + 2;
}

const sumThenApplyCallback = function(nums, callback) {
    let sum = 0;
    for (const num of nums) {
        sum += num;
    }
    console.log("sum", sum);
    return callback(sum);
}

const result = sumThenApplyCallback([1, 2, 3], addTwo);
console.log("result", result);

> sum 6
> result 8
```
## Callbacks and Higher Order Functions 
* A callback is a funtion that gets passed to another function to be executed by that function. 
* Callback functions are used all over the place in JavaScript. 
* They encapsulate reusable code that can be passed around, and so they help keeping functions simple and for each function to have a 'single responsibility'. 
* We call the function that accepts another function as an argument a <b> higher order function </b>
``` js
const myFunction = function() {
  // do something
}

const myHigherOrderFunction = function(callback) {
  callback(); // equivalent to myFunction()
}

myHigherOrderFunction(myFunction);
```

## Anonymous Functions 
* We can pass callback functions <i> inline </i> to a <b> higher order function </b> rather than storing the callback in a variable first. 
* A "hand-waving" way to understand <i> inline </i>  is "in the same line, and not somewhere else". To define a function inline is to define it right where it is used. 

``` js
const myHigherOrderFunction = function(callback) {
  callback();
}

// the function we pass as an argument has no name
myHigherOrderFunction(function() {});
```
* Anonymous functions are simply functions that do not have a name. 
* Why? [Naming thing is hard](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html)

## Arrow functions 
* Arrow function are an alternative way to define functions.
``` js 
// function keyword
const addTwo = function(num) {
    return num + 2;
}

// arrow function
const addTwo = (num) => {
    return num + 2;
}

// `()`s are optional for functions with exactly one parameter
const addTwo = num => {
    return num + 2;
}

// For one-line functions, the return statement becomes implicit
const addTwo = num => num + 2

// For functions with zero parameters, `()` is mandatory
const alwaysTrue = () => true;

// For functions with multiple parameters. `()` are also mandatory
const addTwoNumbers = (num1, num2) => num1 + num2;
```

* Arrow functions are often used as callbacks because they are shorter/cleaner to type. 

``` js
arr.forEach(function(element) {});

// vs
arr.forEach((element) => {});
```
## Arrow functions should not be used as methods
``` js
const car = {
    maxFuelLevel: 100,
    fuelLevel: 10,
    displayFuelLevel: function () {
        console.log(`Currently fueled at ${this.fuelLevel}L ${this.fuelLevel / this.maxFuelLevel * 100}% of max`);
    }
}
```
With regular function declaration syntax, the context of the function is the car object.

```js
const car = {
    maxFuelLevel: 100,
    fuelLevel: 10,
    displayFuelLevel: () => {
        console.log(`Currently fueled at ${this.fuelLevel}L ${this.fuelLevel / this.maxFuelLevel * 100}% of max`);
    }
}
```

## Array iteration functions 
There are a few useful array iteration functions that we should know: 
* filter
* map
* reduce
* forEach

Filter returns an arrat with only the values that pass a conditional check.

``` js
 const evens = [1, 2, 3, 4].filter(num => num % 2 === 0);
console.log(evens); // > [2, 4]

const properNouns = ["Ian", "cat", "dog", "Taiwo"].filter(name => name[0].toUpperCase() === name[0]);
console.log(properNouns); // > ["Ian", "Taiwo"]
```

How could we implement our own version of ```filter```?
```js
// accepts a callback that returns a boolean
const filter = function (array, callback) {
    const result = [];
    for (const item of array) {
        if (callback(item)) {
            result.push(item);
        } else {
            // DO NOTHING
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```
Map returns an array with a modification applied to each array item. 
```js
const doubled = [1, 2, 3, 4].map(num => num * 2);
console.log(doubled);

const capitalized = ["ian", "dog", "cat", "Taiwo"].map(name => name[0].toUpperCase() + name.slice(1));
```
ForEach is just like a ```for...of``` loop, but the loop body is a callback:
```js
// To print each value
[1, 2, 3, 4].forEach(num => console.log(num));
```
* Note: I discourage the use of ```forEach```, because it has several disadvantages compared to a regular loop, and its semantics often lead to unexpected bugs! Here is a [good summary](https://www.designcise.com/web/tutorial/when-not-to-use-the-javascript-foreach-loop) of its problems, don't worry about the 4th case, just the first 3 are good-enough reasons to avoid ```forEach```. 

Reduce is a very fundamental loop iteration function, with which we can build all of the other functions. It is a <i> very powerful </i> , and <i> very generic </i>, and as a result ut cab ve rather confusing. I recommend weighing the benefits of using it with readability. 

``` js
[1, 2, 3].reduce((accum, num) => num + accum, 0);

[1, 2, 3].reduce((accum, num) => num > 1 ? accum.concat(num) : accum, [])
```
